Hello, and welcome to my website!  

I am a fifth year Ph. D. student in the Department of Statistics, at UC Davis, working with Professor Jie Peng.  

Previously, I obtained my M.S. in Statistics, also at UC Davis. 

My research interests include statistical signal processing, graphical models, high dimensional inference, and applications to biomedical data.
